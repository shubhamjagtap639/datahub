/**
 * Big list is a component that will render a list of items using request animation frames.
 *
 * The goal is to achieve less than 16 ms per frame to render. Since the user will specify
 * the block template that will be used for every item, depending on how complex it is that template,
 * the use can play with chunkSize to make it load faster if the template is light.
 *
 * When the list has finished loading, there is an action will be trigger with the last index rendered. At that point
 * the user has the option to not return anything, or to return a promise that will resolve in more items to append to the list.
 * That behavior is handy to load more server side items when the ui list has finished rendering.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * <BigList @list={{items}} @chunkSize={{chunkSize}} @onFinished={{onFinished}} as |item|>
 *   <span class="number">{{item}}</span>
 * </BigList>
