# Druid

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[druid]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, and tables
- Column types associated with each table

**Note**: It is important to explicitly define the deny schema pattern for internal Druid databases (lookup & sys) if adding a schema pattern. Otherwise, the crawler may crash before processing relevant databases. This deny pattern is defined by default but is overriden by user-submitted configurations.

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: druid
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: "localhost:8082"

    # Credentials
    username: admin
    password: password

sink:
  # sink configs
```

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.
