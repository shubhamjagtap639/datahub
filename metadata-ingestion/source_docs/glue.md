# Glue

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[glue]'`.

Note: if you also have files in S3 that you'd like to ingest, we recommend you use Glue's built-in data catalog. See [here](../s3-ingestion.md) for a quick guide on how to set up a crawler on Glue and ingest the outputs with DataHub.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Tables in the Glue catalog
- Column types associated with each table
- Table metadata, such as owner, description and parameters
- Jobs and their component transformations, data sources, and data sinks

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: glue
  config:
    # Coordinates
    aws_region: "my-aws-region"

sink:
  # sink configs
```
