# Redshift

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../README.md).

## Setup

To install this plugin, run `pip install 'acryl-datahub[redshift]'`.

## Capabilities

This plugin extracts the following:

- Metadata for databases, schemas, views and tables
- Column types associated with each table
- Also supports PostGIS extensions
- Table, row, and column statistics via optional [SQL profiling](./sql_profiles.md)

## Quickstart recipe

Check out the following recipe to get started with ingestion! See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../README.md#recipes).

```yml
source:
  type: redshift
  config:
    # Coordinates
    host_port: example.something.us-west-2.redshift.amazonaws.com:5439
    database: DemoDatabase

    # Credentials
    username: user
    password: pass

    # Options
    options:
      # driver_option: some-option

    include_views: True # whether to include views, defaults to True
    include_tables: True # whether to include views, defaults to True

sink:
  # sink configs
```

  <summary>Extra options when running Redshift behind a proxy</summary>

This requires you to have already installed the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server.
See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/pyodbc/step-1-configure-development-environment-for-pyodbc-python-development?view=sql-server-ver15

```yml
source:
  type: redshift
  config:
    host_port: my-proxy-hostname:5439

    options:
      connect_args:
        sslmode: "prefer" # or "require" or "verify-ca"
        sslrootcert: ~ # needed to unpin the AWS Redshift certificate

sink:
  # sink configs
```

</details>

## Config details

Note that a `.` is used to denote nested fields in the YAML recipe.

As a SQL-based service, the Athena integration is also supported by our SQL profiler. See [here](./sql_profiles.md) for more details on configuration.
