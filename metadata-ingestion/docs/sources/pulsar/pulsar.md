## Integration Details

<!-- Plain-language description of what this integration is meant to do.  -->
<!-- Include details about where metadata is extracted from (ie. logs, source API, manifest, etc.)   -->

The Datahub Pulsar source plugin extracts `topic` and `schema` metadata from an Apache Pulsar instance and ingest the information into Datahub. The plugin uses the [Pulsar admin Rest API interface](https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/#) to interact with the Pulsar instance. The following APIs are used in order to:
- [Get the list of existing tenants](https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/#tag/tenants)
- [Get the list of namespaces associated with each tenant](https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/#tag/namespaces)
- [Get the list of topics associated with each namespace](https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/#tag/persistent-topic)
    - persistent topics
    - persistent partitioned topics
    - non-persistent topics
    - non-persistent partitioned topics
- [Get the latest schema associated with each topic](https://pulsar.apache.org/admin-rest-api/#tag/schemas)

The data is extracted on `tenant` and `namespace` basis, topics with corresponding schema (if available) are ingested as [Dataset](docs/generated/metamodel/entities/dataset.md) into Datahub. Some additional values like `schema description`, `schema_version`, `schema_type` and `partitioned` are included as `DatasetProperties`.


### Concept Mapping

<!-- This should be a manual mapping of concepts from the source to the DataHub Metadata Model -->
<!-- Authors should provide as much context as possible about how this mapping was generated, including assumptions made, known shortcuts, & any other caveats -->

This ingestion source maps the following Source System Concepts to DataHub Concepts:

## Metadata Ingestion Quickstart

For context on getting started with ingestion, check out our [metadata ingestion guide](../../../../metadata-ingestion/README.md).

### Prerequisites

In order to ingest metadata from Apache Pulsar, you will need:

* Access to a Pulsar Instance, if authentication is enabled a valid access token.
* Pulsar version >= 2.7.0
* ...

> **_NOTE:_**  A _superUser_ role is required for listing all existing tenants within a Pulsar instance.
>

### Install the Plugin(s)

Run the following commands to install the relevant plugin(s):

`pip install 'acryl-datahub[pulsar]'`

### Configure the Ingestion Recipe(s)

Use the following recipe(s) to get started with ingestion. See [below](#config-details) for full configuration options.

_For general pointers on writing and running a recipe, see our [main recipe guide](../../../../metadata-ingestion/README.md#recipes)._

#### Quickstart recipe
Getting started receipt
```yml
source:
  type: pulsar
  config:
    # Required fields
    web_service_url: "http://localhost:8080"

sink:
  # sink configs
```


#### Example recipe with authentication
An example recipe for ingesting from a Pulsar instance with oauth authentication and ssl enabled.


```yml
source: 
  type: "pulsar" 
  config:
    env: "TEST" 
    platform_instance: "local"
    ## Pulsar client connection config ## 
    web_service_url: "https://localhost:8443"
    verify_ssl: "/opt/certs/ca.cert.pem"
    # Issuer url for auth document, for example "http://localhost:8083/realms/pulsar"
    issuer_url: <issuer_url>
    client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
    client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
    # Tenant list to scrape 
    tenants:
      - tenant_1
      - tenant_2
    # Topic filter pattern 
    topic_patterns:
      allow:
        - ".*sales.*"

sink:
  # sink configs
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Always use TLS encryption in a production environment and use variable substitution for sensitive information (e.g. ${CLIENT_ID} and ${CLIENT_SECRET}).
