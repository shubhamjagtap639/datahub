# WhereHows Docker 
[Docker](http://www.docker.com) is a bit like a virtual machine.  Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.   
  
The docker directory contains all docker related source code. 
Through the docker build provides a whole server instance running in docker container.   

## Quick Installation
1. install ```docker``` and ```docker-compose``` (http://www.docker.com)  
1. From the wherehows-docker, run ```build.sh 1```
1. Edit .env to match your environment
1. From the docker directory: ```$ docker-compose up```
1. In your local browser, open http://localhost:9001
1. The backend app is hosted on http://localhost:19001
1. The Elasticsearch server is hosted on http://localhost:9200

If any step fails in the script, you can run individual steps in it, the script is pretty intuitive and has comments.

## Prerequisites
- Mac OS: Mac must be a 2010 or newer model, with Intelâ€™s hardware support for memory management unit (MMU) virtualization;  
  i.e. Extended Page Tables (EPT) and Unrestricted Mode.
- Windows: Docker for Windows requires Microsoft Hyper-V to run.
- Linux: A 64-bit installation, Linux kernel version 3.10 or higher.  
  ie. RHEL 7.x above

> First ensure that docker and docker-compose are installed, and that the user running this is a member of the docker group, or is root.
> The docker compose script uses version 3, so be sure that the version you install supports that.

## Running Servers
Ensure all docker container instances are up and running
- Frontend app:  
    ```http://localhost:9001```  
- Backend app:  
    ```http://localhost:19001```  
- Elasticsearch server:   
    ```http://localhost:9200```    
- MySQL server:    
    ```host:localhost```   
    ```port:3306```

## Troubleshooting
- Docker. Error: Cannot start container: port has already been allocated  
  From the docker ps output, there is a container which is listening on port. Need to stop your host server daemon.
  If you have a MySQL server on local machine, you should kill a mysqld on the host.
  ```
  $ docker ps  
  
  ```
  

- Not updated backend/frontend code after you change code  
  Need to rebuild docker images and restart docker containers 
  ```
  $ ./build 1
  $ docker-compose up
  ```
