# <RFC title>

## Summary

> Brief explanation of the feature.

## Basic example

> If the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example. Omit this section if it's not applicable.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?
>
> Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted, the motivation could be used to develop
> alternative solutions. In other words, enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
> closely to the solution you have in mind.

## Detailed design

> This is the bulk of the RFC.

> Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the framework to understand, and for somebody familiar
> with the implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include examples of how the
> feature is used. Any new terminology should be defined here.

## How we teach this

> What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this idea best presented? As a continuation
> of existing DataHub patterns, or as a wholly new one?

> What audience or audiences would be impacted by this change? Just DataHub backend developers? Frontend developers?
> Users of the DataHub application itself?

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the DataHub guides must be re-organized or altered? Does it change how
> DataHub is taught to new users at any level?

> How should this feature be introduced and taught to existing audiences?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching DataHub, on the integration of this feature with
> other existing and planned features, on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

> This section could also include prior art, that is, how other frameworks in the same domain have solved this problem.

## Rollout / Adoption Strategy

> If we implemented this proposal, how will existing users / developers adopt it? Is it a breaking change? Can we write
> automatic refactoring / migration tools? Can we provide a runtime adapter library for the original API it replaces? 

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
