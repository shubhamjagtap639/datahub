# DataHub Town Hall

We hold regular virtual town hall meetings to meet with DataHub community. 
Currently it's bi-weekly but we're open to adjust the cadence based on the community's need.
It's the perfect venue to meet the team behind DataHub and other users, as well as to ask higher-level questions, such as roadmap and product direction.
From time to time we also use the opportunity to showcase upcoming features.
