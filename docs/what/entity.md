# What is an entity?

An entity is very similar to the concept of a [resource](https://linkedin.github.io/rest.li/user_guide/restli_server#writing-resources) in [rest.li](http://rest.li/). 
Generally speaking, an entity should have a defined [URN](urn.md) and a corresponding 
[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) API for the metadata associated with a particular instance of the entity. A particular instance of an entity is essentially a node in the [metadata graph](graph.md).

In the above example graph, `Dataset`, `User`, and `Group` are entities. A specific dataset, e.g. `/data/tracking/PageViewEvent`, is an instance of `Dataset` entity, much like how the LDAP group `datahub-dev` is an instance of Group entity.

Unlike rest.li, there’s no concept of sub-entity ([sub-resource](https://github.com/linkedin/rest.li/wiki/Rest.li-User-Guide#sub-resources) in rest.li). 
In other words, entities are always top-level and non-nesting. Instead, nestedness is modeled using relationships, 
e.g. `Contains`, `IsPartOf`, `HasA`, which is covered in the [Relationship](relationship.md) section.

Entities may also contain attributes, which are in the form of key-value pairs. 
Each attribute is indexed to support fast attribute-based querying, 
e.g. find all the `User`s that have the job title `Software Engineer`. 
There may be a size limitation on the value imposed by the underlying indexing system, 
but it suffices to assume that the values should kept at relatively small in size, say less than 1KB.

The value of each attribute is expected to be derived from either the entity’s URN or 
from the metadata associated with the entity. Another way to understand the attributes of an entity is to treat them as a complex virtual view over the URN and metadata with indexing support on each column of the view. Just like a virtual view where one is not supposed to store data in the view directly, but to derive it from the underlying tables, the value for the attributes should also be derived. How the actual derivation happens is covered in the [Metadata Serving](../architecture/architecture.md#metadata-serving) section.

There’s no need to explicitly create or destroy entity instances. An entity instance will be automatically created in the graph whenever a new relationship involving the instance is formed, or when a new metadata aspect is attached to the instance. 
Each entity has a special boolean attribute `removed`, which is used to mark the entity as `soft deleted`, 
without destroying existing relationships and attached metadata. This is useful for quickly reviving an incorrectly deleted entity instance without losing valuable metadata, e.g. human authored content.

An example schema for the `Dataset` entity is shown below. Note that:
1. Each entity is expected to have a `urn` field with an entity-specific URN type.
2. The optional `removed` field is captured in BaseEntity, which is expected to be included by all entities.
3. All other fields are expected to be of primitive types or enum only. 
While it may be possible to support other complex types, namely array, union, map, and record, 
this mostly depends on the underlying indexing system. For simplicity, we only allow numeric or string-like values for now.
4. The `urn` field is non-optional, while all other fields must be optional. 
This is to support `partial update` when only a selective number of attributes need to be altered.
